# object oriented programming

a programming technique which is evolve around objects.

object:::: 

what??   entity 

1. have state/properties example name age etc
2. have behavior/properties example bath,walk etc

why?
relate with real life impliment
good readbility
maintainance easy
easy to use

class => blueprint
object => instance of a class

by default all data member of a class is private

# important terms 

greedy alignment:
When objects are stored in memory, compilers may add extra space (padding) to align data members for faster access. This is called greedy alignment. It can lead to unused memory between members.

padding:
Padding is the extra unused memory added by the compiler to align data members in memory. It helps improve performance but can increase memory usage.

memory leak:
A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory but fails to release it after use. Over time, this can exhaust available memory and cause the program to crash or slow down.

garbage collector:
A garbage collector is a system that automatically frees memory that is no longer in use by the program. It helps prevent memory leaks by reclaiming unused memory.

 # access modifiers 

access modifiers:
public : which access by in and out side of class
private : which can access by inside of class
protected : which can access by inside of class and by inheritance

# constructor

default constructor: (constructor is always in public access modifiers)
to initialize object
no return type
name same as class
called automatically in beginning
a class has many constructor but with diff parameter

default constructor
parameterized constructor
copy constructor

# destructor

default destructor: (it is run after the work of object is over)

# 4 pillar of OOPS

1.encapsulation
2.inheritance
3. polymophism
4.abstraction

# abstraction is a father of all three other

if you think in oops , abstraction se alag hone ki ladai me chale gye tb tum loop me fas jaoge

1. Encapsulation - like class which prevents all data 
(data hiding)

perfect encapsulation means all data members are private;

2. Inheritance (gain property and member from base class)

types - 

base class  (inherit) public      protected   private
ka access
modifiers

public                public      protected   private
protected             protected   protected   private
private               n/a           n/a         n/a

protected is like private but it can be inherited by derive class where private class can't

1. single level
2. multi level
3. multiple
4. hierarchical
5. hybrid

3. polymorphis (exist in many form)
 1. compile time polymorphism 

  1. func overloading
  2. operator overloading

 2. run time polymorphism

  1. func or method overriding

4. Abstraction (like car controls and manual which give into to run but won't tell about engines)

# const keyword

use to declare that a variable , fucntion or object its value can't be change after initialization.

compiler may be able to store variable in read only memory which cause faster result

you can declare a func as const which meaans that it does not modify the state of the objects it is called on;

const use in member func family where you don't want to change the member variable


# shallow copy and deep copy

swallow copy me ekdono same location ko point krte hai. swallow copy done default copy ctor
but deep copy me dono pointer alag alag ko point krte hai

# static keyword in class

if we make object from normal class then how the member func know which object is called that function.

obj1.print();
oj2.printt(); 

ek hidden parameter pass hota hai . This parameter jo particular uss object se related hota hai.
dono ke liye this pointer alag honge

static data members => this variable is going to share memory with all of the class instances

static data func=> there is no instance of that class being passed into that method (no this pointer passed)

class abc{
  public:
  static int x,y;
}
to accesss these => int abc::x;
use by => obj1.x ; obj2.x ; //both print value of same x and both are exact same

in static data func we only accesss static data members

# Friend function

Used to share the inforamtion of a class that was previously hidden

private and protected ko use karne ka tarika

no use bcz low code readbility

# inline function

use for small function

use small function 100 times

function call ki jagah hu function rakh do . No need to fxn calling repeatedly;

used with small size function and that executables are small (handled automatic by compiler optimisation levels);


# can constructor and destructor made virtual ??

yes , but we need to access constructor by friend function

# can constructor and destructor made virtual ??

constructor => no, ctor can't be virtual because when ctor of a class is executed there is no virtual table in the memory, means no virtual pointer defined yet.so, the ctor should always be non - virtaul

destructor => yes, it is really imp to handle proper dtor of derived class;
