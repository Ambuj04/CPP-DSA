# Linked List Notes
A linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, where each element (node

linked list is a non continuous mem loc and non linear data structure

dynamic grow and shrink

low memory waste

insert and delete in O(1) time

no need to shift elements

linked list is a collection of nodes


#  singly linked list

each node has a data and a pointer to the next node

# doubly linked list

each node has a data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node

#circular singly linked list

no head and tail, the last node points to the first node

here delete and insertion occurs basis of values of the node

just search the value and delete or insert

# doubly circular linked list

each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node
the last node's next pointer points to the first node, and the first node's previous pointer points to the last node
allows traversal in both directions in a circular manner
efficient for operations that require frequent insertions and deletions at both ends
no node is truly the head or tail, as the list forms a closed loop
