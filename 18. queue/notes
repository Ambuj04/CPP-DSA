Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The element inserted first is the one to be removed first.

Key Operations:
- Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- Front/Peek: Get the value of the front element without removing it.
- isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
- isFull: (For fixed-size queues) Check if the queue is full.

Applications:
- Scheduling (CPU, printers)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs
- Handling requests in web servers

Types:
- Simple Queue (Linear Queue)
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue
- Double-Ended Queue (Deque)

Example (Python):
from collections import deque

queue = deque()
queue.append(1)      # Enqueue
queue.append(2)
front = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue (returns 1)


used in graph and sliding windows

rear is always in empty location (linear queue)
